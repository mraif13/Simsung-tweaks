4. Once it shows up, enter the following: adb devices if it's command prompt if it's powershell enter this: ./adb devices
5. You will see that the system is starting the ADB daemon starting. If this is your first time running ADB, you should see a prompt on your phone asking you to authorize a connection with the computer. Grant it by clicking on OK and tick the "Always allow from this computer" for later use.
6. Afterwards retype in adb devices or ./adb devices in the terminal/command if you see  the serial number of your device then you're good if not try reconnecting your device and trying again.

## FAQ

<b>1.</b> Device not showing?
- Try downloading the Samsung Drivers <a href="https://d3unf4s5rp9dfh.cloudfront.net/Mobile_doc/SAMSUNG_USB_Driver_for_Mobile_Phones.exe">here</a>

Or

- Try enabling debugging option under developer options in the settings.

<b>2.</b> How to do I enable Developer options/USB Debugging?
1. From a Home screen, swipe up or down from the center of the display to access the apps screen.
2. Navigate: Settings icon > Developer options.

<b>4.</b> Battery Drain or Device lag
- It's nearly impossible to get any battery drain from these commands, but you never know, If this is the case then your only solution is to back up everything using Smart Switch then Reset your phone. Report the version you're using so I can investigate the issue.

<b>5.</b> Can Xtweaks access my pictures or personal contacts?
- Please read the privacy section <a href="#privacy">here.</a>

<b>6.</b> Can I use this on something else? Like a Oneplus phone or something?
- No, I wouldn't recommend it. These commands are meant to only work on Samsung devices. But we're working on bring support to other OEM soon enough.
